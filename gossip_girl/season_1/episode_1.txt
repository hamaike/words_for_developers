'S party In under 90 seconds And didn't even have onncello.
Has our bad girl really gone good? Or is it all just part of the act? Young lady, you can't be here.
Visiting hours are over.

, gossip girl.
Serena? Serena? Hey.
Hey, how are you? You know i've been better.
Eric, i know i've been a terrible sister oh, i'm just so happy to see you.
Must be a lot of rumors why you're back.
Yeah, but none of them mention you.
Just like mom wants, huh?What do i want, baby? For serena to sleep in her own bed, possibly wearing pajamas.
Morning, mom.
Hey, i was just about to ask the doctor If i could take eric to breakfast.
Wanna come? Um no.
I think what i'll do is go get him a croissant down the street.
Serena, don't.
Let me guess-You told everyone Eric's just visiting grandpa in rhode island.
Your aunt carol in miami.
So you're actually hiding him?He tries to take his own life, - And you're worried it's gonna cost you "mom of the year"? - Serena, you've been gone, Doing who knows what with god knows who- I told you, boarding school was not like that.
Then you know what? As happy as i am to have you home, You have no idea what it's been like.
Guess whose dad is cool? It's a trick question.
Yeah, 'cause it can't be ours.
Ha ha, ha ha.
Look at this.
"Top ten forgotten bands of the '90s.
" Yeah, check out who's number nine.
He's very proud.
Mm-Hmm.
Hey! Hey, way to be forgotten.
But that's how you get remembered.
Maybe you'd care if dad's band was on "gossip girl.
" What? I don't read "gossip girl.
" That's-That's for chicks.
So that wasn't your laptop open to it last night Reading all about serena van der woodsen?"Rolling stone"? Wow.
Let me take a look at this again, dad.
Tr√®s cool.
Lincoln hawk-Number nine.
Hey,what are you working on?It's called Everyone's going.
You were invited to that? Well, no offense if i sound surprised Since i've never been invited.
One of the girls in my art class saw my calligraphy, And she said that if i addressed all the invitations That i could have one.
Sounds very fair.
The sweatshops could learn a thing or two.
Dad, this is not a platform For one of your anticapitalist rants.
Yes, it is.
Besides, you make us go to private school.
That's for your education.
So we should just be anonymous losers who eat lunch alone - And never get invited to parties? - Works for me.
Mom thinks it's a good idea.
And her judgment is always sound, right? Jenny, you wanna go to that party, you should go.
You kids could use some fun.
Nate? Oh, hey.
Uh, your mom told me You guys were staying here at the palace.
Yeah, uh,we're renovating again.
You know my mom-If it's not broke, break it.
So what are you doing here? Oh, i just wanted to see how you were.
You seemed kind of upset last night.
I- I gotta get going and change for school.
I'm gonna be late.
Serena- No.
No.
But you're back now-I didn't come back for you.
Look, blair's my best friend,and you're her boyfriend, And she loves you.
That's the way things are supposed to be.
Hey,watch where yore gng! Serena looked effing hot last night.
There's something wrong with that level of perfection.
It needs to be violated.
You're telling me if you had the chance-I have a girlfriend.
You guys have been dating since kindergarten And you haven't sealed the deal.
Who says, "seal the deal"? Come on.
Are you following us or something? No, i-I go to your school.
Identical uniforms?Is that kind of a tip-Off? That's funny.
So you guys wanna sit together at lunch? So cute! These should be framed or something.
Not bad work.
And here's yours, as promised.
Thanks.
Hey.
Here you guys are.
I looked all over the dining hall for you.
Oh, hi, i'm serena.
I know.
I mean, hi, i'm jenny.
Hi.
So when's the party? Saturday.
And you're kinda not invited since until 12 hours ago, Everyone thought you were at boarding school.
Now we're full, and, uh,jenny used up all the invites.
Um, actually-You can go now.
Sorry.
No, that's okay.
I got a lot of stuff to do anyway.
Well,we should get going then.
Unless you want us to wait for you.
Looks like you got a lot of yogurt left.
No, go ahead.
Blair,think we could meet tonight? I'd love to, But i'm doing something with nate tonight.
The palace.
8:00? Nate will wait.
Spotted on the steps of the met- An s.
And b.
Power struggle.
I could probably do a half-Hour.
Did s.
Think she could waltz home, And things would be just like they were? - Thanks for making the time.
You're my best friend.
Did b.
Think s.
Would go down without a fight? Or can these two hotties work it out? There's nothing gossip gir Than a good catfight, And this could be a classic.
Uh, you know-You know, dad, There's this thing called myspace N wheryou capost all this information online.
Save some trees.
Have a blog.
Maybe if musicians got off their blogs And picked up their guitars, The music business would be in better shape.
- Spoken like a true relic.
- Thanks, son.
Hey, dad, listen, um, i gotta run.
Are you gonna be okay? Yeah.
Yeah,your mom will be back.
She's always been a free spirit.
That's one of the reasons i fell for her in the first place.
I meant with the fliers.
Luckily,staple guns are old school.
* sing* na, na, na, na Go.
I'm gonna be fine.
All right.
* na, na, na, na I talked to the nurse,and i'm kidnapping you.
We're going shopping, We're going to bendel's, just for an hour, though, i swear.
I had a really bad day.
Really? 'Cause i had a day- A couple of pills,bunch of rorschach tests.
They had this green jell-O for lunch.
Mmm! Why didn't you save me any? We gotta get you out of here before mom shows up.
Jenny, what is it? What's wrong? Do you like this on me? Wait-Wait a second.
Is that why you needed me? I thought this was an emergency.
A fashion emergency.
I mean come on, i've never been to a big dance before.
Neither have i.
Yeah, but mom's gone, and dad's allergic to department stores.
Well, you look good, jen.
You do, really.
Thanks.
I mean, too bad it's more than our rent, But i think i can sew something like it.
Oh, my gosh, it's serena.
Hi, serena! Hey! Hey.
Jenny, right?Yeah.
Hi.
This is my- Stylist and personal shopper eric.
Hi.
Uh, hi.
Um, this is my brother.
Or um, so is-Is that your dress for the kiss on the lips party? Sort of.
Speaking of that, um, here.
I made you one during free period, But if anyone asks where you got it, i know nothing.
Thanks.
Dan? Dan? Jenny? That dress would look even better in black.
Black.
Cool.
Thanks.
* all the ladies say hey * This is some good stuff.
Yeah, i'm gonna need it.
Blair's mom's at the country house.
Yeah? Well, then maybe i should swipe some of my dad's viagra or my mom's paxil? Nathaniel, you're finally about to have sex With your girlfriend.
It's like you're headed to your execution.
No, man, i'm good.
Talk to chuck, buddy.
You and blair have been dating forever.
- All of a sudden there's a problem? - There's no problem.
It's just do you ever feel like Our whole lives have been planned out for us, That we're just gonna end up like our parents? Man, that's a dark thought.
And aren't we entitled to choose, just to be happy?Look, easy, socrates.
What we're entitled to is a trust fund, Maybe a house in the hamptons,a prescription drug problem.
But happiness does not seem to be on the menu, So smoke up and seal the deal with blair, 'Cause you're also entitled to tap that ass.
So how's your mom doing with the divorce and everything? Great.
So my dad left her for another man.
She lost 15 pounds,got an eye lift.
- It's been good for her.
- I'm really sorry.
Yeah, i could tell,since you didn't call or write The entire time it was happening.
No, i-I know, i was just-Boarding school is like-I don't even know why You went to boarding school to being with.
Do you know how it felt Calling your house when you didn't show up at school And having your mom say,"serena didn't tell you That she moved to connecticut?" I just i-I had to go.
I just- I needed to get away from everything.
Please, just trust me.
How can i trust you when i feel like i don't even know you? Let's fix that.
I saw you at school with-With katy and is, And i-I get it.
I- I don't want to take any of that away from you- Because it's just yours to take if you want it.
No, that-That's not what i mean.
I i miss you.
I just want things to go back to the way they used to be- You know,walking to school together, Dancing on tables at bungalow, Night swimming at your mom's country house.
You were like my sister.
You know,and with our families we need each other.
Well you missed some classic eleanor waldorf meltdowns.
If it wasn't such a tragedy,it would've been funny.
Actually, it kind of was.
Hmm, well, i wish i could've been there.
You are now.
I have to meet nate.
Kinda have something special planned.
Well, i don't want to keep you, but, um i love you, b.
I love you, too, s.
Spotted at the palace hotel- S.
And b.
Having a heart-To-Heart.
Hmm, why so thirsty, s.
? You may have won over b.
For now, But we still think you're hiding something.
Hey.
Ah,the invisible man returns.
You know, i really had no idea you could move that fast.
Yeah, well, uh, your fashion emergency was solved, - So i figured my work was done.
- Come on, dan.
Serena said hi to you at a ninth grade birthday party, - And you've never forgotten it.
- How could i? She was And i'm pretty sure she thought i was someone else.
You know,she's actually nice.
And if she did know you,i think she'd really like you.
I don't know.
I think she might be a tad overwhelmed By the glitz and the glamour of the humphrey lifestyle.
Well, i heard she's living at the palace hotel well, my-My point exactly.
Probably sitting at the bar by herself, Sipping martinis, all alone.
You know,it's actually kind of sad.
Oh, and, um, dad's at the gallery working late.
He, uh,left money for dinner, So i was thinking indian.
You know-You know what?I think i'm i'm gonna go out.
Ok Good,'cause i already ordered And only got enough for one.
Move, please.
I love this town.
I'm going to have to tell my parents The hotel they just bought is serving minors.
And if you get a drink,they're also serving pigs.
- I love it when you talk dirty.
- You just love Actually, i prefer them when they're not talking.
Mm, i've missed your witty banter.
Let's catch up, take our clothes off, stare at each other.
How about i just get a bite to eat? I've been drinking on an empty stomach.
I heard you didn't do that anymore.
Special occasion.
Oh.
Well, how about a grilled cheese with truffle oil? You do love truffles.
Enough to know it's not on the menu.
Good thing i'm connected.
Whoa.
Only 'cause i'm hungry.
Wow.
Hi.
Hi.
Is it too much? I want it to be special.
What's wrong? Look,i don't know how to say this or if it's even the right thing to do, But,um there's something i need to tell you.
Alfonso,you're a stud.
Now,uh,have a good night.
We're closing the kitchen early.
Oh,my god.
This is so good.
Well,if you're looking for a way to thank me, I've got a couple ideas.
It's a sandwich,chuck.
this is mnh-Mnh.
This is not happening right now.
You worried nate'll find out? What? Last year the shepherd wedding.
You think i don't know why you left town? Come on,hurry up.
You know we're not supposed to be in here.
Oh,if the happy couple didn't want To put up the cash for the premium bar, They should have made their wedding b.
Y.
O.
B.
No! Let me see it.
No,make me.
I can do it.

No,you can't.
Let me just show you.
Here,come here.
Let me see it.
I can do it.
Stop.
Let me see it.
Ooh! Oh,no.
nate! That never happens to me.
It's okay.
You're still a man in my eyes.
Come here.
Look at you.
You're a mess.
So are you.
But that was it.
You guys kissed.
Best friend and the boyfriend.
That's pretty classy,s.
I think you're more like me than you'd admit.
No.
No,that-That was then.
I i'm trying to change.
I liked you better before.
Chuck,stop it.
Stop.
No! Chuck,stop it! I knew it! I always knew there was something! Get out! Chuck! No! Get off of me! Oh! Oh! i'm so sorry.
Are-Are you okay? and just when b.
And s.
Had built a bridge, It all had to come crashing down.
But dry your eyes.
The kiss on the lips party is around the corner.
And you know who loves parties? Gossip girl.
Nice try,son.
maybe next time.
You seem upbeat this morning.
Did you have fun with blair last night? Actually,we got into a pretty big fight.
Oh,you want my advice? Apologize, even if it was her fault.
Flowers,maybe some jewelry if she's really upset.
Always works for your mom.
I don't know.
I think it might be for the best.
Wait a minute.
You guys broke up? Yeah,i guess we did.
Blair is a great girl.
I know.
I'm just not sure if she's the girl for me.
And you guys have been dating since kindergarten.
So i keep hearing.
Well,you love her, don't you? Yes,i do.
It might be good for us to take a break,you know? Maybe not right now.
Eleanor waldorf is gearing up to take her company public, And i've been courting her for months To let me handle the deal.
Then you should get it.
I will get it.
If you could just help me out a little bit what? You love her.
She loves you.
It's just a rough patch, that's all.
You don't give up just because things are hard, Not in business,or if your family is depending on you.
How do you know it was miss van der woodsen's If you didn't read it? And if you're not a guest at the hotel, What were you doing here? What? Uh,look,when prince charming found cinderella's slipper, They didn't accuse him of having a foot fetish.
Uh,and you're prince charming? Well well,there's miss van der woodsen now.
No,no! Uh,serena? No,no,no,no,no.
What are you doing? Don't.
Hey,um,do you know this young man? She doesn't know me.
Nobody knows me.
It's cool.
It's fine.
Uh from last night.
Are you um,i'm sorry about that.
You remember me? She remembers me.
Well,he claims he found your cell phone.
Oh! You found it.
Hey,mom.
Guess what i got for you - A dress for kiss on the lips.
I saw the invitation on the nightstand.
Oh,uh, i'm not going to that.

Thank you.
Yeah,no,uh it's not a problem,really.
So you'll pick me up at 8:00? You'd really go out with some guy you don't know? Well,you can't be worse than the guys i do know.

Really? And how are you gonna do that? I'm gonna put everything in the past.
I'm not gonna see serena again or even talk to her.
It'll be like she doesn't exist.
* splashing around in the muck and the mire * I think that's a good idea.
Let's not mention it again.
You gonna eat that? That's it? 'Cause you were pretty upset last night.
I mean, should we talk about this? There's nothing to talk about.
I overreacted.
If you say it's in the past, it's in the past.
