I got three cases of champagne for Serena Van Der Woodsen.
For me? Who's it from? Porn and handcuffs? This is low,Chuck,even for you.
What's this? Chuck said it came for you this morning.
Whoa.
Is that coke? How do you like a brother who uses you as a drug mule? - I can't believe you think Chuck is doing these things.
- What's he done now? I'll tell you what he's done.
If we're gonna exist under the same roof, - I am laying down some house rules.
- No need,princess.
Bart already kicked me out.
- I'm moving back to my suite.
-I love you,Nate Archibald.
Always have,always will.
I want nothing else to do with you,Blair.
It's over.
Jenny,if you walk away from me now,I will ruin you.
- How are you gonna do that? - My mother's Valentino was stolen.
- Oh,my god.
That's my mother's dress.
- Do you think that you can just send me off to school With a plaid skirt and a metrocard, - And everything will be okay? - I'm really sorry, Chuck.
I know it wasn't you who sent me that stuff.
And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell.
You know you love me.

There are three things we do alone-- We are born,we die, And if we're a high school junior headed for college, We take the S.
A.
T.
And while the test is said to measure our best traits, Preparing for it Inevitably brings out the worst humility becomes self-doubt Guess we're all in trouble,huh? Striving becomes obsession.
"It's Tuesday on the other side of town" Some are driven to self-medication "Most would just give up for dead" So I said,"Alfie,don't get so upset" We all get scared of sticking out our necks It's expected While others cling to the security Of being part of a group.
Ooh,Ah Ba,Ba,Ba Ba,Ba,Sha-Doo,Be-Doo Ba,Ba,Ba And anyone who's used to bending the rules Will find themselves breaking them.
Ba,ba,ba,ba,ba,sha-doo Come on,come on it's time to lose control Come on,come on turn off your radio Come on,come on you're gonna feel all right Come on,come on let's do the panic tonight Uhh! Ugh! Dad,don't ever do that again.
Just doing what I was told.
time's up.
I was instructed that whenever time was up, I should share that information.
Yes,but the manner in which you went about itit was like - You were deliberately trying to humiliate me.
- How about? Uh half.
I finished exactly half in the allowed time.
- Well,you're a smart kid.
- I'm a choker.
I choke.
Mm,just in your head.
T-ball.
First grade.
Remember this? Bases loaded, and I stuck out.
You were 6.
The ball was on a tee,not moving.
You'll come through.
You're basing that on what,exactly? Blind faith? - Bye.
-Wait.
- Dad,I'm gonna be late.
- I'm coming with you.
- What? You're walking me to school? - Ineed the exercise.
I made one mistake.
It doesn't mean I need - A human ankle monitor.
- You used to beg me to walk you to school.
- You'd cry if I didn't walk you to class.
- That wasn't me.
that was Dan.
It's true,but I was 6, And it an emotional time for me.
It was post-t-ball.
Jenny,what you did was wrong And really out of character.
Grounding you is not just about punishment.
- We need to spend some time together, reconnect.
- Yeah, I want that,too.
Just not in public and in front of my friends.
All right.
Tonight.
Dinner.
Okay.
And I have group rehearsal.
- I'm the alto.
- And I'm really proud, But we are connecting this evening over Lasagna.
Hey,Jen,you wanna wait up for a second? we could take the Well,A-All right,I'll see ya at school.
It's 90th percentile.
Which means Nelly Yuki probably got 2300.
And you don't even talk to her.
why do you care how she does? Nelly Yuki has her sights set on Yale,too.
What are the odds Of them accepting two girls from constance? And have you seen Nelly Yuki's extracurriculars? I need to kick her well-rounded ass.
And they say you've lost your edge.
Nelly Yuki must be destroyed.
- Why do you keep saying her name? - Because it's Nelly Yuki.
Ew,gross.
Incoming--chuck.
You ready? No,I gotta wait for Dan.
He's pretty stressed.
He doesn't do well with tests,so performance anxiety? Bye,Blair.
She really needs to tone down on the social niceties.
It's embarrassing.
Eventually,the two of you - Are gonna have to work out your issues.
- What issues? I'm issue-free.
And,uh,based on my exhaustive research, So are you.
Georgina? According to my very reliable sources, Georgina Sparks is nowhere near our fair isle.
She's in switzerland,dating the prince of Belfort.
There's a prince of Belfort? uh-huh.
And she's dating him? oh,thank God.
Now you can enjoy the gifts she mailed you With peace of mind and maybe Chuck in the room.
Oh,shoot.
Except we're siblings.
Georgie always brought out the devil in you.
Part of me is a little disappointed she's not here.
Mm,I wonder which part.
It's been a while since I saw the old Serena.
Well,thanks to her, The new one has to break 2000 on her S.

What other people do or don't do is about them,absolutely.
Not a good tester,huh? Oh,Chuck,I had no idea you felt that way about me.
Good to know you're at least still kind of funny.
Hey,I'm so sorry.

Luckily daddy didn't need the g5.
Haven't you missed me? How could I not? Okay.
You don't want to throw me a homecoming party.
I get it,but let's have a cocktail, Catch up.
S.
,you're really gonna hurt my feelings, And you know how I get when my feelings are hurt.
Great.
I'll see you tonight.
It's so weird seeing you.
It's almost like i never left.
Spotted in the courtyard-- Serena looking like she's seen a ghost-- The ghost of parties past.
- Jenny,why did you want to meet here? - Well,I've been thinking-- What's the one thing that no one in our group has, I mean,not even Blair? - Compassion? No,a boyfriend.
you know,if I'm gonna make it to queen, I need a king.
Queen Elizabeth never had a boyfriend.
But she only had the spanish to conquer, And I have Blair Waldorf.
Let's talk qualifications.
He has to be cute,but not fool of himself.
He has to be from the right kind of family Ugh,but not disgusting.
Come on.
Whoa! Oh,oh,aw I'm so sorry.

Well,if you change your mind What are you doing? He's gorgeous.
He's a dog walker.
I need a king,not a jester.
Come on.
Let's go lurk outside dalton.
- Hey.
- Vanessa.
You're nate,right? You play a very small but crucial role In my video project.
- Oh,that's right.
I remember you following Dan around with your video camera.
- Hey,Nate.
What are you doing here? I mean,I know the coffee's good Since I've taken every s.
a.
t.
prep and review class In the five boroughs,I figured why not pay it forward? So--so you don't need these? You know,I've actually already taken it.
My parents don't want me going to u.
s.
c.
, So I had to make sure my scores were good enough To get in without their help,which,thanks to these books, They were,so i'm done.
- While we all love hearing about the struggles of the idle rich, Dan's got a fine tutor right here.
I ace every practice test i take, - So we don't need your hand-me-downs.
- Um,you know what? th-this is actually pretty good.
- This looks good.
thank you.
- Is there a reason you insist On looking so desperate and needy? - She's been like that since we were kids-- Venomous without provocation.
It's better than being a charity case.
She's rude,too.
I see that.
Yeah.
Well,i gotta get going, But i hope these are useful.
Oh,yeah,yeah,very.
Thank you.
What? They're--hey,every little bit helps.
Is this really the best place for us to talk? You of all people know Nothing gets me talking like a cosmo.
A lot has changed since we used to hang out,Georgie.
- I know.
I get it.
- No,you don't get it,or you wouldn't have sent me All those so-called gifts in the first place.
Oh,come on,sweetie.
Those were funny.
Get over yourself.
I was just trying to make you laugh.
How about this-- How about for one night, We hang out like old times,but unlike old times, I won't get out of control,unless you want me to.
I mean,i can totally get out-- No,okay.
I-i won't get out of control, And i totally respect that.
Please stop me any time you feel like answering.
Any time.
come on.
One drink,but only one.
Cheers.
Where are all the tutors? - And the masseuses? - And the smoothies? All that i have promised you is waiting.
And while it gives me great pleasure To think of us crossing that s.
a.
t.
finish line together, Before the race can begin, You need to be made aware of one little thing.
Nelly Yuki,top in our class, Summer schooled at the Sorbonne.
Lots of people do summer at Sorbonne,including me.
True.
Penelope,you may be a national merit scholar, But Nelly Yuki is a merit scholar A Peabody scholar And an intel science talent search finalist.
Isabel,you're a concert pianist, But Itzhak Perlman himself gave Nelly her very first violin.
Hazel You're just along for the ride,'kay? But if any of us wants to live out our college dreams, We have to find Nelly Yuki's weakness And exploit it.
So what's it gonna be-- aromatherapy or annihilation? What's the plan? It was,like,the worst thing ever, And then--and then,do you remember? Do you remember when we ran out of money? And then i had to flash the bartender 'Cause we ran out of money.
Wait,wait.
Oh,my god.
Remember when we were Savannah and Svetlana? - Oh,Savannah.
Savannah! I totally forgot about Savannah and Svetlana.
Svetlana.
Wait,no,I think we were Tiffany and Angel that night.
Oh,you could talk me into anything.
Hey,ladies,can i,uh,get you guys another round? - Ooh.
- No,thank you.
Hmm.
Oh.
My american girlfriend, So uptight.
They think the drink lead to the sex.
No,no,no,I wasn't being rude.
I just didn't want to take anything If I couldn't offer anything in return.
We'd be happy with just one dance.
Aw.

Aw,this is what is the practice for.
Come on,lady.
Opa! Who is that? Um,no one.
uh,thank you for calling back.

I have to go.
Hey,come here.
Whoo! I'm so stupid,so,so,so,so stupid.
You don't sound stupid.
You sound drunk.
What have you been into? Georgina.
Good news is,she doesn't want anything except to party.
Bad news is,I partied.
Care to paint a picture? Does this party require clothes? I'm supposed to be at Dan's studying.
I called to tell him I'd be late, But not this late.
II just have to call him and say That instead of studying with him, You're out with your old pal Georgina.
No.
I don't want him to know she exists.
My mom,Blair,even you can't stand her.
Dan of all people cannot know Georgie.
Can you help me? Say you need me.
Chuck! Hearing you scream my name is more than enough.
I'll take care of it and pick you up in ten.
Hey,I've been wondering where you were.
You mean all of your life? Uh,don't take this the wrong way,Serena, But you sound just like this jackass we know.
Serena has food poisoning.
She's too sick to come to your playdate.
Put her on the phone.
The bathroom doesn't get reception.
Somehow I don't believe you.
And I'd like to say I'm a little glad about that, But my poor,sick sister has asked for my assistance In the matter,so I'll leave it at this She's not coming.
Don't try calling.
Humphrey,always a pleasure.
I'm gonna have to call you back.
Hey.
Beautiful day you're ruining,isn't it? Do me a favor,please,and leave Serena alone.
It was Serena I was doing a favor All i know is before spring break, Everything was great.
It was good.
Now break's over,she's not quite herself, And I'mI'm trying to think,what has changed in her life? Oh,the Bass family moved into it.
Dan,hi.
Hey.
hey,how you feeling? Good.
my Migraine's gone.
Migraine? I thought you had food poisoning.
Yeah,that came after.
What exactly happened last night? I already told him.
I'm asking Well,I got food poisoning,and then Chuck helped me out.
Okay,where exactly did you eat That you got this killer food poisoning Migraine? Can we drop the interrogation? As soon as you tell me where my girlfriend is.
I'm right here with you.
Look,II gotta go to class.
I can't I can't do this.
This is exactly why I didn't want her to come back.
She's been back a day already and look what's happening.
If it's really that bad, Why don't you just tell him about her? I can't.
I'll see you later.
Look,I'm not stupid.
I know you're not really interested In how my family owns half of tribeca.
of course we're interested.
You're the newest member of our little club.
Which is only for the smartest girls of the junior class.
Our junior class only has 30 girls.
We're already an elite club.
Can I go now? You what would be hot? you,us at G Spa.
I don't drink.
Saks fifth? hate shopping.
Yogurt on the steps? lactose-intolerant.
Look,I really don't want any friends.
All I want is to be alone And to listen to Florida ever again.
What happened? A little backstage hit it and quit it? What? No,my boyfriend broke up with me at a Florida Concert.
One minute we were waving our hands in the air Like we just didn't care,and the next Since the dalton guys were a bust, How about collegiate? The boys' lacrosse team is working out just around Jenny,look.
What did I tell you about that dog walker? There are no kings on Craigslist.
But I don't think he's the walker.
I think he's the owner.
I spy my king.
Hi.
How have you been? Oh,god.
Not that song.
Nelly Yuki,what's wrong? It's like it's happening all over again.
That song just reminds me of my boyfriend My ex-boyfriend,I should say.
Oh,no.
Did he dump you? That's horrible.
Wwwhat was his name? Brad? Bill? Todd Jansen.
There's nothing like the fresh,sharp pain of a breakup.
Believe me,I've had my fair share of heartache, But this is about you.
Tonight you're gonna come over to my house, And just cry till you get it all out of your system.
I can't.
I have to be focused tomorrow.
You can't focus when something's on your mind, Now can you? come,come,come.
Tell me all about it.
I guess I'll just take the check,please.
Okay.
Hey, hold that, will ya? Daylight Savings moved to March.
Maybe no one told you.
I know I'm late.
Coffee, Nate? Yeah,thanks,Cora.
You two know each other? I've been here before.
Are you telling me you come all the way to Brookn For greek food? Well,when I'm Brooklyn,I like to come here,yes.
'Cause you're in Brooklyn all the time.
Well,mymy father's in rehab a couple blocks away, And,uh,which,by the way, is why I'm late.
I was Visiting hours I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to No.
I mean, it's not like it's some big secret.
It was on the front page of every newspaper in the city.
I guess it was, yeah.
Sometimes after I'm done seeing him, I'm not ready to go back and see my mom just yet, So I come here and I sit and just, uh Think about how hard it is To know whose side you're supposed to be on, Mom versus dad, kid in the middle? Confession I read one of your practice essays.
You left it in a book that you gave dan, And that's why I called you to apologize.
Why? Because I judged the cover, But now that I've read the book, I figured you were owed some apologetic souvlaki, At the very least.
Hey, Georgie.
It was good to see you last night.
When did you say you were going back to Belgium? Uh, Switzerland, actually, And I'm supposed to leave tomorrow, But I'm not going until I get a chance To make it up to you first.
Oh, nothing to make up.
I had fun.
No, you didn't.
I mean, until after you left, I don't think I really heard what you were saying.
I-I didn't get it.
You've really changed.
Yeah, I have.
I don't mean to sound corny, But it's a real inspiration to me.
Really? I mean, look, I've always thought That i am who I'm going to be for the rest of my life, And even those times when I maybe don't like myself, Well you can't decide to be somebody else.
No, you can.
yeah, listen, let's have dinner.
I-I mean, I want to hear about your life, And if you can change, maybe there's hope for me, too.
No, i-i have to study.

Seeing as you've returned the valentino, And you've logged ten hours of volunteer work With Betty at the shop - I'm not grounded anymore? I have something for you.
No way! - Oh! - It's not exactly the same as the one you pawned, But Thank you, dad! You know, Jen, no one's happier than me to see this.
Do you know how much it costs to get a zipper repaired? - Yeah, I figured since you'd be spending so much time at home - Wait.
What? - So I guess you're still grounded.
- Dan.
- Dad, wait.
- I met this really nice guy, And I'm supposed to meet him in the park for lunch tomorrow.

- It's not a date.
He's just a friend.
- Who is this guy? - You don't know him.
He goes to unity.
- Wait, upper east side unity? - Technically, that's upper west side, dad.
- How are you helping? - I thought you wanted to take a break from that whole crowd.
- What "whole crowd"? - The one that made you feel like compromising your character Was a prerequisite to hanging out with them.
- So it's okay for dan to date someone rich, though? Well, it's not without its complications.
Believe me.
I thought you said it wasn't a date.
It was nice there for a minute.
- It was.
Hey, S.
I'm just sipping a gingko biloba blended And wondering how your stomach migraine is.
Call me so i don't worry.
How you doing, Nelly Yuki? My upper trapezius seems to hold a lot of sadness.

Lucky for us, Mental acuity and common sense rarely come in the same package.
Oxygen facials, anyone? Next time your sister's band is in town, I want front row seats.
You don't strike me as a lesbian punk fan.

You know the guy with the ironic mustache? You two took over the deejay booth.

Chuck? Chuck, hey.

I am intrigued.
You wish your brother good luck today? Yeah.
May I be excused? No, you may not.
And we are not gonna walk around this house all day And not talk to each other.
Fine.
You want me to speak?I'll speak.
You've completely and entirely prejudged the upper east side.
Maybe you shouldn't speak.
dad, I learned my lesson on my birthday.
Asher's not like those girls.
He's different.
I mean, he's nice and polite and he likes animals.
Please let me go today? So you didn't cancel? I thought you'd change your mind.
I haven't.
Nate, I don't know about this.
I can't.
I didn't even study.
Yeah, and you still made great scores On your practice tests.
That was for fun.
Listen, there's nothing wrong with keeping your options open.
I don't think your parents are gonna be mad at you For choosing your own path Unless they're related to my parents.
Okay.
Right now I'm going inside, And I'm not looking back, or I might change my mind.
Do really well.
What? Rough night? Yeah,and not in a good way.
Todd doesn't wanna get back together.

Unbelievable.
I can't believe it.

I got no sleep,spent the whole night crying.
